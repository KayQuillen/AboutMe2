    I am very new to the developer world. In fact, before Feb. 2020, I had never even seen code. Needless to say, making the decision
    to change careers was a scary one. I had made up my mind to change my life, so for the last three months I have immersed myself in 
    programming. I have linked a few of my projects above.

    I started my journey with Javascript, got in some CSS and HTML along the way. Four weeks in the class was canceled due to the small class 
    size. My classmates and I were not left high and dry though. We were given the opportunity to learn fullstack with Ruby on Rails ,
    even got some Sinatra in along the way. I have continued my study of Javascript outside of class and look forward to broadening my 
    knowlege of not only Ruby and Javascript but all that the development world has to offer.
